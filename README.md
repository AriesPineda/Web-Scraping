# Web-Scraping

## Use to scrape data from a website(Text,URL & Table Data)

This small Web Scraper Project is a versatile web scraping tool leveraging Selenium for browser automation and Pandas for data manipulation. Users input the target website's URL, optional XPath for a cookie acceptance button, and the desired number of pages to scrape. The script initializes a Chrome WebDriver, handles cookie acceptance if applicable, and manages CSV file creation and encoding detection. Users can choose between scraping individual page elements or entire tables, with the script dynamically adapting to user-defined XPaths and providing summary reports of the scraping process. This interactive tool empowers users to efficiently collect structured data from websites, making it adaptable for a range of web scraping scenarios.
